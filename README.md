# Database Systems Lab
**Semester 2 (2025-26)**  
**Language:** SQL  

This repository contains SQL queries and solutions for weekly lab exercises in the **Database Systems (DBMS)** course. Each folder corresponds to one week of lab work and includes well-documented SQL queries and explanations.

---

## Folder-wise Breakdown

### WEEK1 — Basic SQL Queries
- Writing simple SQL queries to select, insert, update, and delete records.
- Use of `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements to manage student and sales records.
- Applying basic conditions using `WHERE`, `AND`, and `OR`.

### WEEK2 — Joins and Subqueries
- Writing SQL queries involving **INNER JOIN**, **LEFT JOIN**, **RIGHT JOIN**, and **FULL OUTER JOIN**.
- Using subqueries for filtering and sorting data.
- Understanding and applying relationships between multiple tables.

### WEEK3 — SQL Aggregation Functions
- Using aggregation functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, and `MIN()`.
- Grouping results with the `GROUP BY` clause and filtering with `HAVING`.
- Writing queries to calculate total sales, average purchases, and number of customers.

### WEEK4 — Database Design and Normalization
- Designing tables and relationships using **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD)**.
- Normalization techniques to eliminate redundancy and improve data integrity.
- Converting **ERD** to **Relational Schema**.

### WEEK5 — SQL Queries for Complex Operations
- Writing SQL queries for data manipulation involving **JOINs**, **GROUP BY**, and aggregate functions.
- Querying for the highest sales, most frequent customers, and more.
- Working with multiple tables to retrieve meaningful insights.

### WEEK6 — SQL Queries with Aggregate Functions
- Demonstrate the use of SQL aggregate functions like `COUNT()`, `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `MAX()`, and `MIN()`.
- Create SQL queries to calculate the total sales, average purchase amount, and number of customers from the database.
- Grouping and filtering data using `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses.
- SQL joins including **INNER JOIN**, **LEFT JOIN**, and **RIGHT JOIN**.
- Implement queries that deal with customer orders, such as counting orders per salesperson, total sales, and customers by city.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShamScripts/DBMS.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the folder for the week you'd like to explore.
3. Execute the SQL queries on your preferred SQL client (like MySQL Workbench, SQLite, etc.).

## Notes
- All queries are written in SQL and designed to be executed on relational databases.
- File handling and user interaction are incorporated where relevant in database operations.
- Performance analysis for some queries is included in relevant sections.
